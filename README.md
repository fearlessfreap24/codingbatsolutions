This repository was set up to use www.codingbat.com to practice Python. I've set up my files to run independently.

If there is a T/F return, my program will print "true" or "false" from the result of the function.

There are several problems that were so easy that I didn't bother making a script for it.

I also had completed Warmup-1 through String-2 before I decided to use an IDE to solve the problems. I may go back
and make scripts for the ones I've already completed.
